He developed a taste for action films by watching World War II film on television as a child.[2] As a teenager, he saw the film Tom Jones, which he said ""made the greatest impression"" on him, ultimately making him ""want to be in movies.""[3] He attended Sacramento State College, earning a B.A. in art in 1969.[1] While interested in the film industry, he initially thought that his art training would lead him to a career in art direction or production design. Not wanting to ""serve in the ranks"", he decided that directing would be most satisfying.[4] He entered graduate school at UCLA film school, hoping to start a career in directing.[1] He couldn't afford to pay for his own film, processing, and equipment. But he did own a typewriter, so he took a writing course and prepared to study screenwriting instead of directing.[5] At UCLA, he took classes under Richard Walter.[6] Boam took an advanced screenwriting class taught by William Froug. He decided to ""target"" Froug, hoping to impress the writing teacher into accepting him to be a directed studies student. Boam was impressed by Froug's success, and wanted one-on-one help. He said, ""I just knew that Bill could help me, but I needed more than the slightly impersonal, two-hour-a-week instruction of the class.""[7] He gave Froug two screenplays for review, but the writing teacher wasn't impressed with either of them.[8] This didn't deter Boam, who persisted. Boam told Froug, ""Well, I'll just have to write better.""
